I'm excited to share my latest project with you all: a Disney+hotstar clone!
I've been working on this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm proud of what I've been able to accomplish. The site includes many of the same features as the real Disney+ platform, such as a homepage with recommended content, search functionality, and Moving sliders.
I was able to create a visually appealing and user-friendly clone that I hope you'll enjoy exploring my new project
